## üåç **The Story**

**The year is 2047.** You are **Captain Favnon Peng**, elite tactical specialist and leading the last defenders of **Sector 7**, a critical military outpost on the edge of the **Red Zone** - a wasteland overrun by mutated creatures and rogue AI constructs.

After the AI uprising of 2042, humanity's last strongholds are scattered across the globe. Sector 7 houses critical research data and the last known cure for the neural plague that's spreading through the remaining population. The facility's experimental neural enhancement programs have created enhanced human operatives with **AI-bonded animal companions** - all fighting to preserve what remains of civilization.

**Your mission:** Hold the perimeter at all costs. The enemy waves are endless, but you must survive. Use every weapon, every strategy, every ally at your disposal. The fate of humanity depends on your survival.

*The Red Zone doesn't forgive. The Red Zone doesn't forget. The Red Zone is coming for you.*
